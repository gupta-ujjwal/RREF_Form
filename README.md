# RREF_Form
A java program which converts any given matrix to RREF(Reduced Row Echelon Form). 

A matrix is in Reduced Row Echelon Form if:

1.  All nonzero rows (rows with at least one nonzero element) are above any rows of all zeroes (all zero rows, if any, belong at the bottom of the matrix), and
2.  The leading coefficient (the first nonzero number from the left, also called the pivot) of a nonzero row is always strictly to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it (some texts add the condition that the leading coefficient must be 1[1]).

RREF matrix are used to solve system of linear equations and balancing chemical equations.
