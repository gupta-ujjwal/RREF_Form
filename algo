1- start
2- Declare an DD array of dimension [row][col+1] //col+1 is for markers
3- first row should have an element at 0th pos. if not replace it with the next row having 1 as marker for this send the array to func rep()
4- Declare a for loop with i=0 to i<n
5-check if i>=row
6-check if a[i][i] is not 0 if it is then replace it with next row having element other than 0
6- pass the array and i to a function(mark) which  marks 0 row i.e. 0 if first element is 0 else 1
7- now pass the array and i to func div() which divides the element of the whole row with ith element if marker of row=1 
8- now pass the array and i to a function which ssubtracts each row with marker 1 with the i row 
9- for loop ends
10- print
